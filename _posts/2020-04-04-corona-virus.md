In the early stages of the COVID-19 I made a blog post article about the number of cases in each country over the period of a couple weeks. You can view my original Medium blog post [here](https://medium.com/@palmerturley34/how-dangerous-is-corona-virus-4ef7d2687941).

The data was collected by Johns Hopkins University and covers the number of confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths in each country. The data was from January 22nd to March 7th.

I used the data given to create visualizations of how the virus had been spreading during that time. The visualizations can be found in the original blog post, but the most notable one shows the spread of the virus over time including number of confirmed cases, active cases, recoveries, and deaths.
