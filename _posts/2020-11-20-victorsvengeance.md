During Dixie State University's annual Code Camp event my brother-in-law and I worked on this project. Code Camp is a 24 hour event, where teams work to create any project they want. We decided to make a simple tiled base game where you control a character named Victor. Victor is trapped by zombies, surrounded by zombies. You use Victor to push the blocks and trap the zombies so they cannot move. Once you trap the zombies they turn into coins that you can collect for points while more zombies spawn. Your goal is to survive as long as possible and collect as many coins as you can.
