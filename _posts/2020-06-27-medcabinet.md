As a group project as part of the Lambda School curriculum, my group was tasked with creating a website to help people find recommendations for different strains of medical marijuana.
My job was to create a Heroku app that uses data science to make those recommendations. That app can be found [here](https://medcabinet1flaskapi.herokuapp.com/).
I used a free online API, [The Strain API](https://strains.evanbusse.com/), as data. The app takes in desired properties of marijuana such as flavor and medical conditions they help with and return a list of strains with those properties. The app returns a JSON object so it isn't the easiest to read but does contain a lot of information about each strain.
