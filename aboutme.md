Hi, I'm Palmer. For over a year I have dedicated my time to learning software engineering. I am currently attending Lambda School as a student in the Data Science program, set to graduate in March 2021. I am 25 years old and live in Hurricane, UT. I am married, and together we have one son, and another child on the way! Since joining Lambda School and learning on my own time I have loved every minute of it! I'm excited to start a career in software engineering!
 

### My History

I grew up in a small town in north-west Missouri. My high school graduating class was only around 45 students. In such a small school, there wasn't a whole lot of funding or opportunity for me to reach my goals. Which meant that I had to be very proactive if I was going to be successful. I participated in many extra-curricular activities, including marching and concert band, the basketball team, Future Business Leaders of America and others. I gratuated in the top 3 of my class and afterward became a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, serving two years in Tokyo, Japan. I worked very hard to learn a new language and work on my communication and people skills. I came home and moved to Saint George, Utah and went to work. I've worked doing sales, and currently I work at a distribution center for Orgill, Inc. I often work long hours, exceeding 60 hours a week from time to time. Over the years I've learned the value of hard work, communication, and self motivation. In January 2020, I decided it was time to go to school and start a career in a field I really enjoy. I have always felt that programming would be a fun and successful career path for me, so, at the recomendation of a friend, I joined Lambda School. It has been a great pleasure learning so many new things and exploring my career options.
