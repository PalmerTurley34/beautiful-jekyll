My name is Palmer Turley and I'm a data scientist! I am 24 years old and live in St. George, UT. I currently work at Orgill Inc. as a trainer in the order filling department. I use data in my day to day job to help improve the work environment for all employees in my department.
 

### My History

Ever since I can remember I have always been passionate about data and math. I've always been interested in data exploration and machine learning. In January, 2020, I decided to put my passion to work. I started Lambda School's Data Science program and have been working hard to learn all the skills I need to make a career out of something that I love.
